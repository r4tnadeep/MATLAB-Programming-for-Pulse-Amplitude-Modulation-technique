# MATLAB-Programming-for-Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation-technique
Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM):
PAM is a modulation technique where the amplitude of the pulses is varied according to the instantaneous amplitude of the message signal (analog or digital).
It's one of the basic modulation schemes used in communication systems.

MATLAB for Technical Computing:
MATLAB is used for modelling and simulation of various systems, including signal processing and communication systems. 
It provides a programming environment with tools for analyzing and visualizing data.
